## Modern
In contrast to other charting libraries, which are build upon flash or are commercial,
Vectual is solely based on the newest web standards!
So even your cell phone and your tablet are able to display the beautiful charts!

## Visions
The best part is, that Vectual doesn't have to be limited to static visualization.
Imagine realtime charts, multidimensional charts or even charts which can be played like a video
to show certain data over time!
