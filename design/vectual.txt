Vectual - A Open Source Charting Library
Hi, I'm Adrian Sieber and I'd like to introduce you to vectual
Today the Internet is producing billions of data each day! Billions of numbers and values give a precise image of what's going on in the world!  But unlike the guys from Matrix we aren't able to see whats going on just by watching tons of numbers streaming down the screen =D So how can a human being understand and interpret all those numbers and values? 
That's what vectual does! Vectual is a open source charting library. It visualizes data and helps you to understand it! 
Display beautiful pie charts, bar charts, line charts, scatter charts, tagclouds, maps and tables! You can even display the charts inline, in the form of sparklines, bar-charts or tiny pie-charts! 
In contrast to other charting librarys, which are build upon flash or are commercial, Vectual is open source and solely based on the newest web standards! So even your iPhone and your iPad are able to display the fancy charts! 
What i need now is the time it takes to iron out such a powerful tool! Please make it possible for me to purchase domains and servers and more important to spend every single day of my summer holidays coding. With your help I don't have to waste my time with pointless summer jobs just to be able to finance my studies, pay the next slice of pizza or to pay all the energy drinks I need for  non-stop coding!
Please help me to make the world a little more open and help me to build a awesome piece of software! 
I'd also like you to keep in mind that the functionality of vectual is only limited by the amount of funding you can effort. The more you pledge the more time I'll have to bring vectual to perfection.
Just imagine realtime charts, multidimensional charts or even charts which can be played like a video to show certain data over time! Nothing is impossible!
For further information please check out the description below and the website vectual.org!
...and of course check out the awesome pledges! You will love them!
Thanks for watching and have a nice day!
